# ─── WHAT IS THIS FILE? ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file.
# GitHub reads it automatically whenever you push code.
# It runs your Playwright tests on a clean cloud machine (Ubuntu)
# so you always know whether your tests are passing.
#
# File location matters: must be inside .github/workflows/
# File format: YAML (.yml) — indentation is significant, use spaces not tabs.

# ─── WORKFLOW NAME ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Shown in the GitHub Actions UI under the "Actions" tab of your repo.
name: Playwright Tests

# ─── TRIGGERS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `on` defines what events cause this workflow to run.
#
# push:       runs when you push commits to the main branch
# pull_request: runs when a PR is opened or updated targeting main
#
# This means every commit and every PR gets tested automatically.
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# ─── JOBS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A workflow contains one or more jobs. Each job runs on its own machine.
# Jobs run in parallel by default (useful for running on multiple browsers).
# Here we have one job called `test`.
jobs:
  test:
    # The type of virtual machine to run on.
    # ubuntu-latest is the standard choice — fast, free, and what most CI uses.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # ─── STEPS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # Steps run sequentially inside the job, top to bottom.
    # Each step is either a shell command (`run`) or a pre-built action (`uses`).
    steps:

      # Step 1: Check out your repository code onto the CI machine.
      # `actions/checkout` is an official GitHub Action — it's like running
      # `git clone` so the machine has your files to work with.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install Node.js on the machine.
      # `actions/setup-node` installs the Node version you specify.
      # We pin to Node 20 (LTS) for stability.
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      # Step 3: Install your project's npm dependencies.
      # Same as running `npm install` locally.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Install Playwright's browser binaries.
      # The npm package gives you the Playwright API, but the actual
      # browser executables (Chromium, Firefox, etc.) are downloaded separately.
      # --with-deps also installs OS-level dependencies needed on Linux.
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      # Step 5: Run all your Playwright tests.
      # The CI environment variable is automatically set to "true" by GitHub,
      # which triggers the CI-specific settings in playwright.config.ts:
      #   - retries: 2  (retry flaky tests before marking them failed)
      #   - workers: 1  (run tests sequentially to avoid resource contention)
      #   - forbidOnly: true  (fail if test.only was left in accidentally)
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test

      # Step 6: Upload the HTML report as an artifact.
      # Even if tests fail, the report is saved and downloadable from GitHub.
      # This lets you inspect exactly what failed without re-running locally.
      #
      # `if: always()` means this step runs regardless of whether previous
      # steps succeeded or failed — important so you get the report on failure.
      - name: Upload HTML report
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
          # Keep the report for 30 days before GitHub deletes it
          retention-days: 30
